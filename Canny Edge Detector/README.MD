This is Canny Edge Detector project. the process involves applying a Gaussian filter to smooth the image to remove the noise. Find intensity gradient of the image and apply gradient magnitude thresholding to get rid of spurious response to edge detection. Computed Structural Similarity Index Metric with existing libraries such as scikit-image
